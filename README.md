# [Harmonoid](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/)

#### The music app, that can download music from spotify for free & has no advertisements!

The app is meant to be used in such a way, that you download your favorite music offline & listen it whenever without internet connection.

## THIS IS JUST A PRE-RELEASE

THE CURRENT PRE-RELEASE OF APP IS JUST TO SHOWCASE THE IDEA & FEATURES (i.e. FREE MUSIC DOWNLOAD, OFFLINE PLAYBACK & USER INTERFACE, YOU CAN LOOK AT TEMPORARILY INCLUDED [CURRENTLY ADDED](#zap-currently-added) SECTION OF README.) OF THE APP. MANY FEATURES, THAT AN IDEAL MUSIC APP HAS, ARE STILL MISSING. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE, IF YOU WANT TO. THE UI SHOULD BE SMOOTH BUT, YOU CAN ENCOUNTER DOWNLOAD RELATED BUGS RARELY AT THE MOMENT & I'M TRYING TO FIX THEM. :star: STAR THE REPO TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT.
